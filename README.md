I still have problems with CORS.  you need to use a browser extension (I used moseif origin for chrome) otherwise, you will get a 403 error on the fetch.

I recently found out about object literals, and since I've been using react, it seemed more natural than the previous method of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
The concept is, each widget on the screen is its own function.  If i could roll the CSS into the component, it might be a little easier to track problems with each component.
Also, the fetch component could be logically coded to allow for pagination.  No need to download some giant JSON object, maybe the first 20, then fetch the rest as needed.
